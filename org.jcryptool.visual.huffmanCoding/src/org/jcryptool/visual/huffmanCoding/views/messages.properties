HuffmanCodingView_0=Coding/Decoding
HuffmanCodingView_1=Huffman coding is a method for lossless data compression which assigns to each character of the input text a bit sequence of a variable length depending on the frequency of the occurrence of this character. Frequent characters are represented with a short bit sequence; characters occurring rarely have a longer bit sequence. In this way, redundant information is summarized and the required storage space reduced. In this tab, you can compress or uncompress a text. On the other tabs, you can see the tree structure and the associated, dynamically calculated code table.
