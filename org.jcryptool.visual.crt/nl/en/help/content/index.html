<h1>Chinese Remainder Theorem</h1>

<p>This plug-in shows the functioning of the <b>Chinese Remainder Theorem</b> (CRT).</p>

<p>The <b>CRT</b> plug-in can be started on the menu visualization and it can maximize its view.</p>

<p>The plug-in consists of two columns. On the left side the description and the computational procedure of the current step is presented, and on the right side the input and results of the calculation.
In the <b>Equation</b> group on the right side of the plug-in the parameters of the equation can be entered.</p>

<p>Whole, positive numbers (integers) of any size can be used. By pressing the + button the number of the equations can be increased and it can be reduced by the pressing the - button. The minimum number of equations 
is two. After determining the number of equations and entering the parameters, you can move to the next step by pressing the <b>Step 2</b> button.</p>

<p>If the input parameters of the equations was not correct, a dialog box opens where the user can correct the entry.</p>

<img src="crt_equationCheck.jpg" width="497" height="385">

<p>The user has the possibility to correct his input themselves or allow the program by clicking the button <b>Suggestion</b> to propose a valid value. In both cases the 
user has to confirm with the <b>Apply</b> button. With the <b>OK</b> button the user returns to the program and the dialog box closes. The group <b>Step 2</b> is activated 
and the computational procedure is emphasized.</p>

<img src="crt_step2.jpg" width="391" height="78">

<p>The user can now move on to the third step by pressing the button <b>Step 3</b>.  In the group <b>Inverse</b> the intermediate results of the calculations are shown.</p>

<p>The accompanying explanation has previously been given in <b>Step 2</b> group. <b>Step 3</b> describes the calculation of the inverse element.</p>

<img src="crt_step3.jpg" width="392" height="94">

<p>The next step is then shown in <b>Step 4</b> in the <b>Inverse</b> group.</p>

<img src="crt_inverse2.jpg" width="348" height="197">

<p>The calculation of the final result is described in the last step, <b>Step 4</b>.</p>

<img src="crt_step4.jpg" width="391" height="106">

<p>The final result can now be displayed in the group <b>Result</b> by pressing the buttons <b>Result</b>.</p>

<img src="crt_result.jpg" width="391" height="140">

<p>For the user to verify the accuracy of the solution all the equations are shown again in the <b>Verify</b> group.</p>

<img src="crt_verify.jpg" width="349" height="144">

<p>The user can display further solutions of the simultaneous congruences by clicking the <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b> buttons. The solutions are shown in the <b>Result</b> 
as well as in the <b>Verify</b> group. To initiate a new calculation, it is sufficient to click in the <b>Equation</b> group on the + or - button. This performs a reset of 
all the input fields besides the ones in the <b>Equation</b> group, and you can add or remove other equations. This reset is possible from any step.</p>

<p>After passing through the algorithm, it is possible to export the calculations. The plug-in supports the output as LaTeX, PDF or CSV file.</p>
