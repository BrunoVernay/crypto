Tab0_MessageBox0=You have successfully created a XMSS^MT key pair.
Tab0_Txt0=The eXtended Merkle MultiTree Signature scheme (XMSS^MT) is based on multiple XMSS trees chained together. The advantage compared to a simple XMSS tree which has the same size, is the reduced computation effort to create the key pair. The single trees are connected, by signing the XMSS root node of a lower layer. The lowest layer eventually is used to sign messages. 
Tab0_Txt1=The eXtended Merkle MultiTree Signature scheme (XMSS^MT) uses as OTS the Winterenitz one-time signature (WOTS). Part of this algorithm is the Winternitz parameter w. It determines the signature length. A larger value leads to shorter signatures but increased computation efforts. It does not affect the scheme's security. Although it can be arbitrarily big, it is common practice to use 4 or 16. You will find more information about WOTS+ in the help menu.
Tab0_Txt2=In this scheme multiple single trees with the same height come to use. Here you can set the properties of the single trees and the corresponding amount of one-time signatures. In the process of key generation, the WOTS keypairs and the MultiTree, consisting of normal XMSS trees, is generated.
