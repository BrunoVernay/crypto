MerkleTreeTab_0=Seed and Key Generation
MerkleTreeTab_1=MerkleTree
MerkleTreeTab_2=Key Pair
MerkleTreeTab_3=Message Signing
MerkleTreeTab_4=Verification

MerkleTree_Generation_Info=Please choose a Seed on the first page and generate the key pairs on the first tab. Those are needed to create a MerkleTree.
ZestLabelProvider_0=Leaf
ZestLabelProvider_1=Node
ZestLabelProvider_2=Hash of the public key
ZestLabelProvider_3=Root
ZestLabelProvider_4=Content
ZestLabelProvider_5=Content of Leaf
ZestLabelProvider_6=Content of the Node 
ZestLabelProvider_7=1
ZestLabelProvider_8=0

MerkleTreeKeyTab_0=In this tab is displayed the Key Pair of the scheme\n\nThe Public Key consists of the value of the root node and the seed\nThe Private Key consists of an index of the next OTS-Keypair which shall be used, the seed, and all Private OTS-Keys. These are the secret parts of the OTS-Keys, which public parts are used as leaves for the tree\n\nUse the buttons to highlight the respective key parts! 
MerkleTreeKeyTab_1=Public Key
MerkleTreeKeyTab_2=Private Key
MerkleTreeKeyTab_3=Index
MerkleTreeKeyTab_4=Seed
MerkleTreeKeyTab_5=Private OTS-Key
MerkleTreeKeyTab_6=Colorize Key Parts:

MerkleTreeKey_1=Please generate the keys first.
MerkleTreeKey_2=Keylength:
MerkleTreeKey_3=Byte
MerkleTreeKey_4=You have successfully created a key pair.
MerkleTreeKey_5=The tabs "MerkleTree" and "Key Pair" provide additional informational about the scheme.\r\nIn the tabs "Message Signing" and "Verification" you can create and verify your own signatures.  

MerkleTreeKey_column_0=Key Number
MerkleTreeKey_column_1=Private Key
MerkleTreeKey_column_2=Public Key
MerkleTreeKey_Message=The key pairs where generated successfully!

MerkleTreeSign_0=Please define a message!
MerkleTreeSign_1=This is an example Text\r\nYou can add a message of your choosing that should be signed!
MerkleTreeSign_2=Sign Message
MerkleTreeSign_4=Error during signing, please generate a new tree, all key pairs where already used.
MerkleTreeSign_5=Please enter a message you want to sign.
MerkleTreeSign_6=SignatureLength
MerkleTreeSign_7=current KeyIndex
MerkleTreeSign_8=There are no more OTS keys left. Generate a new keypair!


MerkleTreeVerify_0=The signature, that was created in the \u201ESignature\u201C tab, can now be verified, when the correct index is chosen. This one is chosen initionally. You can also chose an other (wrong) index. If you do so, the verification will fail. The verification starts by calculating the WOTS public key of the WOTS signature. This WOTS key is used to calculate the corresponding leaf of the L-Tree.\r\n\r\nThe following Information is needed for the verification.\r\n\u2022 The public Merkle key\r\n\u2022 The Merkle signature\r\n\u2022 The message\r\n\r\nTo verify a message the OTS public key is calculated from the message and the signature. Together with the index and the authentication path a alternative root node is calculated. If the calculated value matches with the merkle public key, the verification is successful and the signature is accepted, otherwise the verification will fail. 
MerkleTreeVerify_1=Message
MerkleTreeVerify_2=Signature
MerkleTreeVerify_3=Message
MerkleTreeVerify_4=Explanation
MerkleTreeVerify_5=Created Signatures
MerkleTreeVerify_6=Verify
MerkleTreeVerify_7=The verification of the signature with the chosen Node was successful.
MerkleTreeVerify_8=The signature couldn`t be verified successfully!
MerkleTreeVerify_9=Please click Verify to check the chosen Node.
MerkleTreeVerify_10=Path from Root to the chosen Node: 
MerkleTreeVerify_11=Please chose a Leaf to verify the signature. A Node can`t be used to verify the signature!

MerkleTree_Signature_Generation_Info=Please create a signature in the fourth tab first. After you created a signature, it can be verified in this tab. 

UnsavedChanges=Unsaved changes! Do you want to save the changes?


Tab0_Head1=Seed
Tab0_Head2=Generate Key Pairs
Tab0_Head3=Bitmask
Tab0_Head4=Bitmask seed
Tab0_Head5=Winternitz Parameter

Tab0_Txt3=The Bitmask is one of the main differences to the Merkle Signature Scheme. The Bitmask is a pseudorandom choosen binary value. Here you can enter the seed for the pseudorandom generator that generates the Bitmask.

Tab0_Button1=Generate new Seed
Tab0_Button2=Generate Keys
Tab0_Button3=Generate new Bitmask seed

Tab0_Lable1=Number of Keys

InteractiveSignature_Button_0=Interactive Signature Generation
InteractiveSignature_Button_1=Back
InteractiveSignature_Button_2=Next
InteractiveSignature_Button_3=New Signature
InteractiveSignature_Button_4=Verify
InteractiveSignature_Button_5=Simple Signature Generation
InteractiveSignature_1=Welcome to the interactive signature generation.\nPlease enter a message.
InteractiveSignature_2=First we search for a free OTS keypair.
InteractiveSignature_3_1=Here, Leafe 
InteractiveSignature_3_2=is usable.\n We write down the leafe's index.
InteractiveSignature_4_1=The value of leafe 
InteractiveSignature_4_2=is the public key of the one-time-signature. This value is the next part of the signature as it is used to verify the message.
InteractiveSignature_5=We need more information to hash the tree. The values from the red marked nodes are important for the verifier and need to be supplemented.
InteractiveSignature_6=The signature is finished as soon as all needed nodes are supplemented. The signature can be verified in the Tab \"Verify\".
InteractiveSignature_7=Current Index:
InteractiveSignature_8=In this tab you can create signatures. Choose one of the following two options. The only difference between those options is the display of the signature.
InteractiveSignature_9=With the Interactive Signature Generator you can follow the signature generation process step by step.
InteractiveSignature_10=Input a message and get a signature instantaneously.
