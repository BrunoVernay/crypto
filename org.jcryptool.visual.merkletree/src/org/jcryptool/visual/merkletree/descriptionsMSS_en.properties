Tab0_Key_Button=Generate MSS key pair
MerkleTree_Generation_Info=Please create a MSS key pair before proceeding.
Tab0_MessageBox0=You have successfully created a MSS key pair.

Tab0_Txt0=Using the Merkle Signature scheme, messages can be signed quantum computer resistant. The signature is based on many one-time signatures (OTS), which are taken together in a binary hashtree (MerkleTree). The advantage of MerkleTrees is, that all public keys of the one-time signature are hashed and aggregated, building the MerkleTree. This root value is the public Merkle key.
Tab0_Txt1=The Merkle Signature scheme (MSS) uses as OTS the Winterenitz one-time signature (WOTS). Part of this algorithm is the Winternitz parameter w. It determines the signature length. A larger value leads to shorter signatures but increased computation efforts. It does not affect the scheme's security. Although it can be arbitrarily big, it is common practice to use 4 or 16. You will find more information about WOTS+ in the help menu.
Tab0_Txt2=In the process of key generation, a free selectable amount of WOTS key pairs is created using a random seed. Usually only powers of 2 are used.
Tab1_Head0=Merkle Signature scheme
Tab1_Txt0=The MerkleTree illustrated here consists of the hash values of public keys that are always linked together and hashed h (m1|m2) until only the root node remains.\r\n\r\nSignature:\r\nTo sign a message a one-time signature is used. The private OTS key is calculated using the private Merkle key. Only one message can be signed with a OTS key pair. To avoid the second usage of a keypair, the key pairs are numbered from 0 to (2^h)-1. This number is called index of the key pair and is stored in the OTS private key. The index is updated after every signature creation. This prevents that an OTS key pair is used more than once. The Merkle signature is composed of the one time signature, the index of the next unused OTS key pair and the content of the red marked nodes. The red marked nodes are the authentication path.\r\n\r\nVerification:\r\nFor a successful verification of a message the following information is required:\r\n\u2022The public Merkle key\r\n\u2022The Merkle signature (containing OTS signature, index, and authentication path)\r\n\u2022The message\r\nTo verify a message the OTS public key is calculated from the message and the signature. Together with the index and the authentication path a root node public key is calculated. If the calculated value matches with the Merkle public key, the verification is successful and the signature is accepted, otherwise the verification will fail.\r\n\r\nLegend:\r\nYellow: Path of the OTS private key to the root node. Red: Nodes of the  authentication path
Tab1_Txt1=Choose a node to see the hashvalue of it.

Tab2_Txt0=The Signature of the Message has the following content: Index of the Keypair | OTS-Signature | OTS-Public Key | Authentication Path
