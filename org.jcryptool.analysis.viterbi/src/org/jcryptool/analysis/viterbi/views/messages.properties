ViterbiComposite_tab_title=Viterbi-Analysis

ViterbiComposite_description=Basically the Viterbi algorithm is like a frequency analysis. Depending on the probabilities of the single characters it reveals both plaintexts.\r\n\r\nThe function can be summarized as follows (this is just a short explanation of the algorithm)\:\r\n1.\tA character will be disassembled in all possible combinations.\r\n\tIf you use XOR, you are inverting this process with another XOR.\r\n\tThe modular addition is inverted with a modular subtraction.\r\n2.\tThe probability of all combinations is calculated. For these calculations you need a complex language model to consider longer character sequences.\r\n\tTo get a proper solution you also have to take the preceding characters into account.\r\n3. The probabilities for combinations are stored in an ordered manner. Unlikely combinations are not investigated further.
