	<h1>Zudo-Ku</h1>
	
	<p>
	 	The computer tries to convince you that it has solved a Sudoku.
	</p>
	<p>
		Click on "Challenge" and pick a row, a column, or a block.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cards of the respective row/colum/block will be shuffled face down and then exposed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Check, whether the exposed cards satisfy the rules of Sudoku: Each number from 1 to 4 should occur exactly once. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After checking, the computer covers the cards again, shuffles them, and returns them to the board. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Challenge the computer multiple times. How many challenges are necessary until 
		you believe that it knows a correct solution of the Sudoku? What information 
		about the solution did the computer expose to you to convince you? Try to find a 
		solution yourself just by using the facts you learned while challenging the computer. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Click on "Cheat". The computer will now try to convince you although its solution
		is not correct. How many times do you have to challenge the computer until you 
		bust it?
