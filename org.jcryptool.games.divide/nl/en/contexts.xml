    <description>Divider Game is a game for two people invented by Christiane Licht. In 2010 she has won the regional contest in NRW at &quot;Jugend forscht&quot; with it.
The procedure is as follows. First an arbitrary number is chosen. The playing field is then made up of all of the dividers of that number.

A player chooses a random divider. This number and all of its multiples will be removed. This step will be repeated alternately. The player who chooses or is forced to choose the number 1 looses.

The question is whether there is an optimal solution for every starting value for player 1 regardless of which number is choosen by player 2. The game can be used in school to tighten the terms divider and divisibility.

The input of Christiane Licht evaluates a question from game theory. With number theoretical methods a strategy to win can be established.</description>
