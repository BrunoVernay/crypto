DivideView_20=After a starting value has been set and starting of the game all dividers of the starting value will be shown.\nThe default starting value is 2520 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 which has 48 dividers. Additionally you will be asked who should start. You opponent is either the computer (1P / Computer) or another person (1P / 2P).\nSubsequently the players alternately choose one of the shown blue dividers. The selected divider and all its multiples will be grayed out and cannot be chosen anymore.\nThe player who chooses or is forced to choose the number 1 loses. So your goal is not to take the last number.
