HashingView_0=Hashing Visualization
HashingView_1=\nA hash function is a mapping that maps a large input set to a smaller target amount. Here, the input set contain elements of different lengths, the elements of the target amount, however, usually have a fixed length. It is possible to select a hash function and the display of the hash value. The hash value is directly calculated and displayed. The difference between the hash values of the input and output text is directly calculated and displayed at the bottom.
