  <h1>RSA Cryptographic System</h1>

  <p>This help file describes two things:<br/>
  1) <a href="#term">The RSA Scheme</a><br/>
  2) <a href="#plugin">Handling instructions how to use this visualization</a> </p>
  <p> <b>Please note</b> that in this visualization the operations are performed on each single character. In practice, the operations are performed on blocks or even the whole message. Normally, RSA is not used to encrypt large amounts of data. Mostly, it is used to encrypt a symmetric key, which later is used to encrypt the data with a symmetric cryptosystem (e.g., AES or 3DES), or to sign the hash value of a message. </p>

  <h2 id="term">1) Explanation of the RSA Scheme</h2>

  <p> The most well-known asymmetric cryptosystem, the RSA algorithm, was developed in 1977 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman. The private and public keys are constructed using two randomly selected big prime numbers p and q which the user can specify himself but must keep secret. Then, the user chooses two natural numbers e and d such that (e*d) = 1 mod ((p-1)(q-1)).<br/>
  The product p*q = N and e then serve as the public key, d as the private key. <br/>
  As this encryption algorithm only works on numbers, first the plaintext letters must be converted. This is generally done using the ASCII code, but one can of course also agree on A=0, B=1 .... Z=25. <br/>
  However, the number of each plaintext letter must be smaller than the product N. This becomes clear when you examine the encryption and decryption functions (m = plaintext letter, c = ciphertext letter): c = m^e mod N and m = c^d mod N.<br/>
  Calculating modulo you can also first determine the remainder from each factor and then the rest of its product modulo N. It would not always be possible to obtain a unique ciphertext character if m could be bigger than N.<br/>
  The security of the RSA scheme is based on two mathematical problems. First, it is hard to extract a root modulo N (RSA problem). Second, factorization of a number N = p*q is hard, if the factors are sufficiently large (RSA key problem).<br/></p>

  <h3 id="Enc">a) RSA Key Generation</h3>
  <p> A special characteristic of the RSA cryptosystem is that extensive calculations are necessary to generate the RSA key before RSA en-/decryption or signing can take place.<br/>
  First of all, the RSA parameters p, q, N and the Euler number phi(N) are calculated by choosing two different prime numbers p and q at random, and then by calculating the so-called RSA modulus N = p*q. The Euler number phi(N) = (p-1)*(q-1) is calculated from the prime factors p and q.<br/>
  In a second step, the public RSA exponent e is determined and from this, together with phi(N), the secret RSA exponent d is calculated. The number e is chosen as follows 1 &lt; e &lt; phi(N), with the property that e is relatively prime to phi(N). An especially popular value for e is 2^16+1 = 65537, as in most cases this is co-prime to phi(N) and is especially well-suited for square and multiply exponentiation resulting in a very fast public key operation.<br/>
  The secret exponent d = e^(-1) mod phi(N) is calculated as the multiplicative inverse of the public exponent e modulo phi(N). <br/>
  After the RSA key generation, N and e can be published. Then, anyone could encrypt a message for the owner of the according secret RSA key d or check a digital signature -- using only the public key. </p>

  <h3 id="Enc">b) RSA Encryption / Decryption</h3>
  <p> To <b>encrypt</b> data with the RSA scheme, the ciphertext is calculated using the public key e of the recipient and the plaintext. The encryption function is c = m^e mod N. This means that anyone can encrypt a message using the public key. But only the owner of the associated secret key d can then decrypt the message again. </p>

  <p> To <b>decrypt</b> a ciphertext with the RSA scheme, one needs to know the private key d. The decryption function, c^d = (m^e)^d = m^(e*d) = m mod N, yields the plaintext m. </p>

  <h3 id="Sig">c) RSA Signing / Verifying</h3>
  <p> To <b>sign</b> a message m with the RSA scheme, you need to know the private key d. The signing function is applied to m or to a hashvalue of m: m^d = sign(m) or (hash(m))^d = sign(hash(m)). This yields the signature.</p>

  <p> You can <b>verify</b> a digital RSA signature using the signer's public key e by computing (sign(m))^e = m' or (sign(hash(m)))^e = hash(m)'. The result of the RSA exponentiation is m' or hash(m)' which has to be compared with the message m or the hash of the message hash(m) computed from the received (and decrypted) document. If both hash values are identical this is considered as a proof that the real owner of the corresponding private RSA key has signed the document.</p>

  <h2 id="plugin">2) Handling Instructions: How to use this visualization</h2>
  <p> When the RSA visualization is started, you can select the desired operation, encrypt, decrypt, sign, or verify, by choosing the corresponding tab.</p>
  <p> The button colors on the left side show the current status. Red means that the step is not complete. When the buttons are green the corresponding step is complete. If the first two buttons are green, it is possible to start the encryption either with a click on <strong>Start</strong> or to directly finish it with a click on <strong>Encrypt</strong>. Using the button <strong>Reset</strong> it is possible to choose new values.</p>
  <p> First you need to select the required RSA keys. First click on the <strong>Key generation / selection</strong> button. You can choose to create a new keypair or load a saved keypair. When the encryption or verify tab is selected it is also possible to create or choose only a public key. Note that for these operations, encrypt and verify, a secret key is not required.
  <br/> When you choose the option <strong>New key pair</strong> it is possible to choose the parameters p, q, and e out of the drop down list or to fill in custom values. Marking the checkbox <strong>Save key pair</strong> you can store the key for later use.
  <br/> The option <strong>Existing key pair</strong> loads a previously generated key pair. Choose a key out of the list and enter the corresponding password.
  <br/> When the encryption or verify tab is selected it is also possible to choose the options <strong>New public key</strong> and <Strong>Existing public key</Strong>. The option <strong>New public key</strong> allows you to enter N and e, and choose if the key should be saved or not. The option <Strong>Existing public key</Strong> loads a previously stored public key.
  <br/> When you click on <strong>Finish</strong> the chosen key is automatically inserted and can be seen in the "Key" field (converted to hex).</p>
  <p> Next, click the <strong>Enter text</strong> button on the left. You can enter a text using ASCII characters. Every character will be converted to hex and can be seen in the "Entered text" field. If you mark the <strong>Enter numbers directly</strong> checkbox, you can insert decimal numbers separated by "SPACE". These numbers are converted to ASCII characters and can be seen in the "Entered text" field. On the next page it is possible to apply some filters on the text.</p>
  <p> Now, all required information is available and it is possible to start the operation. If you just want to see the result, you can click on the button below the <strong>Enter text</strong> button. To see the calculation of each number click on the <strong>Start</strong> button in the "Step-by-step calculations" field. If you go stepwise or directly through all steps, the result can be seen in the "Result" field. </p>
  <p> On the bottom, you can see additional options. There, you have the possibility to choose whether the key and result should be displayed in dec or hex values, inherit values from one of the three other tabs, and show additional help while performing the operation. </p>
