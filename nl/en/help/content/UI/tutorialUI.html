<h1 style="text-align: center">Usage of the entry dialog for ARC4/Spritz</h1>

<p>This page explains how to use the dialog for the ARC4 cipher. For general information see <a href="../tutorial.html">ARC4/Spritz Encryption</a>.</p>

<h3>Operation - encryption and decryption</h3>
<p>
ARC4 is a stream cipher, that means that the encryption and decryption process does the same. It's always an xor between plaintext or encrypted text on the one hand and the random number on the other hand.</p>

<h3>Variants of ARC4</h3>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
<td>There are many different implementations of ARC4, we have implemented two: Spritz and ARC4. At the implementation of Spritz you can choose a variable called <i>w</i>. For more information see <a href="../tutorial.html">ARC4/Spritz Encryption</a>.</td>

<h3>Key</h3>

<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>You have the possibility to choose between hex and binary representation. If you start writing your key in hex and then change to binary the already written characters will be transformed to binary (it also works the other way round).<br><br></td>
    <td><img src="hex-binary.PNG" width="90" height="42" alt="hex-binary" align="middle"/></td>
  </tr></table>
  <table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>For giving the algorithm a short try, you can  use the random or 0-bitkey generator. Attention: If you plan to decrypt your  message again and you chose random generator you should copy your key before.      <p></p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">The &quot;Finish&quot; button only becomes active  when you have entered a full byte. Nibbles aren't accepted. The keylength  restrictions are also active here (length: 5 - 256 byte).</td>
