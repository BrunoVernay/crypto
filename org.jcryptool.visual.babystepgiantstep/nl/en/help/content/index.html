<h1>Shanks Babystep-Giantstep</h1>

<p>The demonstration shows the functioning of the <b>Shanks Babystep-Giantstep</b> plug-in.<p>

<p><b>Shanks Babystep-Giantstep</b> plug-in could be started by the menu <b>Visualization</b> or via Crypto-Explorer tab <b>Visualization</b> and maximizes his view.<p>

<img src="babystepgiantstep_plugin.jpg">

<p>The view of plug-in contains 6 sections: <p>

<p>The first section describes the algorithm in its execution. The explanations adjust corresponding to the current step.
<p>

<img src="beschreibung.jpg">

<p>The second section contains the user inputs. The values can be entered manually or they can be chosen through the given parameters via the dropdown menus.
<p>

<p>By clicking on the <b>Continue to step 2</b> button will be check the validity of the inputs. Even if one or more of them are invalid a pop-up dialog will open to correct the entries. The invalid values are marked with a red background-color.
<p>

<p>
In section 3 executes the calculations of the group order, the upper bound of the order and the multiplicative inverse.</b>.

<p>
In the next step, section 4, the babysteps are calculated and presented in a table with all the iterations.
<p>

<p>
By clicking on the button <b>Continue to step 4</b> the giantsteps will be calculated. The giantsteps are also presented in a table. Depending on the inputs is it possible that this step is skipped because there is no need to calculate the giantsteps.
<p>

<p>
The button <b>Compute result</b> will be enabled and by clicking on this button the result will be shown in the section <b>Result</b>. If we find a solution for the DL-problem the values of the solution are marked in the tables with the same color as in the <b>Result</b> section.
<p>

<p>

The result is shown in the section <b>Result</b> in color <b>green</b>. In this section the calculation formula is also displayed and the output equation.
<p>

<p>
If there is no solution for the discrete logarithm then a message is displayed.
</p>

<p>
The button <b>Reset input parameters</b> clears all user inputs, the calculations of the result and also clears the contents of the tables and the algorithm can be started again for new user inputs.
