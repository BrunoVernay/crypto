outWelcome_txt =Welcome to JCT-Visualization WOTS/WOTS\n\nThe Winternitz-One-Time-Signature-Algorithm is a hash based method to sign messages. The public key is generated by hashing the randomly generated blocks of the private key. How often the blocks are hashed is determined by the Winternitz parameter w\u22652).\n\nAs a step of calculating the public key, the signature is generated. Because of the one-way functionality of the used hash function it is impossible to get back to the private key using the signature, but with further calculation the result will be the public key.\n\nFor more details visit our online help (press F1 or ?)
outGenKeys_txt =Key generation:\n\nWhen generating the keys, the parameters t,n and w are defined first.\n\nPrivate key:\nt blocks are filled with n random bytes.\n\nPublic key:\nEvery block of the private key is hashed w-1 times, which results into the blocks of the public key.\n\nFor more details and formulas on how to generate the parameters visit our online help (press F1 or ?)
outGenSig_txt =Signature generation:\n\nWhen generating a signature of a message, first the hash-value and a checksum over the hash-value are calculated. These values are split up into t parts and will be used as integer values b_i for further calculations.\n\nTo compute the signature, the blocks of the private key are hashed b_i times.\n\nFor more details and formulas on how to calculate the checksum visit our online help (press F1 or ?)
outVerSig_txt =Signature verification:\n\nTo verify a signature, first the b_i values are calculated (see signature generation).\n\nSecond the blocks of the signature are hashed w-1-b_i times. If the computation matches the blocks of the public key (hashed w-1 times), the signature is valid.\n\nFor more details and formulas on checksum calculation the checksum visit our online help (press F1 or ?)
outGenKeysPlus_txt =Key generation:\n\nWhen generating the keys, the parameters t,n and w are defined first.\n\nPrivate key:\nt blocks are filled with n random bytes.\n\nPublic key:\nAdditionally w-1 random blocks (R) are generated. Now on every block, in w-1 rounds, first a XOR with the block of R followed by the hash function are applied. The public key consists of the calculated blocks and the blocks of R.\n\nFor more details and formulas on how to generate the parameters visit our online help (press F1 or ?)
