JCrypTool Crypto
=======

The **JCrypTool Crypto** project contains all crypto plug-ins for JCrypTool: **Algorithms** (classic, modern and XML Security), **Analysis**, **Games** and **Visualizations**. Basic crypto features are included in this repository too.

These projects require the plug-ins from the [JCrypTool Core](https://github.com/jcryptool/core) repository to compile and to run.

Have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki) for more information, especially the [Getting started as a JCrypTool Developer](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki/Getting-started-as-a-JCrypTool-Developer) page. Feel free to ask any question you might have in our [developers group](http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-developers).

JCrypTool downloads are available as [weekly builds](http://www.cryptool.org/en/jct-downloads-en/jct-downloads-weekly-en) (unstable) and as [release builds](http://www.cryptool.org/en/jct-downloads-en/jct-downloads-stable-en) (stable).

General information on the CrypTool and JCrypTool projects is available in the [CrypTool](http://www.cryptool.org) portal.
